      <h2>ALBUM REVIEW: "DARK SIDE OF THE MOON" - PINK FLOYD (1973)</h2>
      <h5>One of the greatest selling albums of all time, stayed on the Billboard charts for almost a decade, and still under rated! August 27th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/dsotm.png">
      <p>This could very well be my most favorite album of all time. Since first discovering it when I was in high school, I've barely missed a week or even a day of listening to it all the
         way through.</p>
      <p>It's hard to place why sometimes, but this record is truly magical. It is the epoch of both Pink Floyd's work, and progressive rock as a whole. The songs deal with themes about all
         stages in life, and about topics that plague the modern individual, such as consumerism, mental illness, the meaning of life, and death. The beautiful guitar solos from David Gilmour,
         masterful bass lines and singing by Roger Waters, the shimmering piano from Richard Wright, and the pumping drums from Nick Mason give a cohesion and flow that can't be topped. Such a
         pefect balance was not reached by Pink Floyd again, and will be hardpressed to be reached by any band again.</p>
      <p>From the beginning, with pieces like "Breathe" and "On the Run," the production and sound design is invigorating, bringing the listener to another plane of conciousness. Here, an allegory
         for human life develops, showcasing the hectic nature of our existance, and the tumultousness of all of our feelings and senses.</p>
      <p>After this, "Time" addresses the clock ticking while we try to find our place, not sure where to go or what to do. Cynically speaking, we're all living on this great green ball hurtling through
         space, with no where to go, all while death waits around the corner. "The Great Gig in the Sky" speaks to this inevitablity, stating that "we've all gotta go sometimes." With chilling backing vocals
         by Clare Torry, the masterpiece almost brings tears to the eye. Is there reason to life? Do we have a purpose? Do we even need one? It makes one ponder, and occasionally brings up dangerous thoughts,
         but ones that we all must deal with in our evaluation of life.</p>
      <p>The other side of the record starts with "Money," a song decrying consumerism that ironically became Pink Floyd's only number one single. Lyrics like "Money, so they say / Is the root of all evil today"
         can seem juvenile, but are a motif found across earthly media, as it is something we all struggle with. Pursue our passion, and be broke, or live a comforable life? Sometimes we have no passion, which
         leads to much resentment and a reevaulation back at what our place in the universe is. "Us and Them" continues the allegory on life from earlier and the one from "Money," expressing how we often
         look at our fellow humans as outsiders or not, worthy of our charity and praise based solely upon our outdated views on tribalism and arbitrary categorization. Would you watch a man starve if it meant
         you could have your dinner? What if it was a choice between a dying man and your family? These are tough questions, raised by a simple rock album but are heavily present in our human philosophy.</p>
      <p>I often group the final three tracks together (or at least the last two), as they flow wonderfully well as one experience. "Any Colour You Like" is void of any singing at all, instead letting running
         themes and the whining guitar and synths tell the story. One often finds themselves with too much choice, and filled with a paralyzation due to these overwhelming options before them. But is this really
         a choice at all? Or a method of breaking us down and hiding that there often is no choice. We have control of our own destinies, but only to a point. Some things can't be helped and can't be stopped,
         no matter how hard why try. However, does this mean we should give up, and never try at all? Musically I adore this piece, and often listen to it and let my troubled thoughts wane in and out of situations
         I wish would happen, or ones that I wish I'd done differently. It's cathartic, in an admittedly hopeless way. The album ends with "Brain Damage/Eclipse," where one looks at the shaky nature of our internal
         monologue, and at mental illness, as well as the end of our lives on earth. If anyone has ever felt like they were not in right mind, or that there is something going on in their head that is scary or
         worrisome, "Brain Damage" speaks to that feeling. "Eclipse" is the climax of the entire album, with lyrics that might not make a whole lot of sense on first listen, but speak to our own confusion and
         sometimes lack of understanding of our own mind and choices. At the end, everything in our life returns to nothing. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. But this needs not be a scary concept. One day, all our
         failures will be pointless, and our worries will have been for naught. But, so too will be our accomplishments, and our mark on the world. This double edged sword is inescapable, and both terrifying and
         consoling at the same time. How will you choose to live?</p>
      <p>This review turned into an almost philosophical breakdown of the record, but one that I feel shouldn't be understated. It is our very nature to wonder, and this magnum opus of thought that Pink Floyd
         crafts is one that should be experienced and understood by all, for betterment of our mind or worse.</p>
      <p>Rating: 10/10 (and most likely my ONLY 10/10 to give)</p>
      <p>"And if the dam breaks open many years too soon / And if there is no room upon the hill / And if your head explodes with dark foreboding too / I'll see you on the dark side of the moon"</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Keep it real,</p>

      <h2>VIDEO GAME REVIEW: DOOM (2016)</h2>
      <h5>An absolute masterpiece of modern singleplayer shooters, August 25th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/doom.jpg">
      <p>I'm quite late to the party in playing this epic cornerstone of Bethesda's lineup, but boy am I GLAD I finally got around to it!</p>
      <p>I had tried to play this game a couple times before, but just couldn't get into it. My previous rig couldn't handle it all that well, and this discouraged me from pushing forward
         given the title's fast paced nature and reliance on twitch shooting. Since I had recently upgraded my PC, I decided to give it a shot, and immediately was engrossed by the visceral
         graphics, rewarding gameplay, and adrenline-pumping soundtrack.
      <p>For starters, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The different environments the game takes you through in its hours-long campaign are all beautiful and distinct from each other,
         in a way that many FPS developers fail to implement. There is a rich world and story told by the design of the facilities fought through, and by the extremely detailed weapons and
         equipment found along the way.</p>
      <p>However, I'm sure most don't play a game like DOOM for the story. They play for the sharp action and shooting mechanics that make the game fast-paced and electrifying. And this entry
         delivers in a way that hearkens back to the DOOM games of old, while bringing 21st century convenience and style to the tried-and-true formula. New mechanics and methods of maneuvering
         are slowly but surely introduced throughout, with a heavy emphasis on exploration. If one wishes to be able to upgrade their gear to the max to face the hordes of demons facing them,
         they NEED to check every nook and cranny in the game, because there is bound to be something to find. A new weapon, some armor/health/ammo, or even a cure in game collectable to remind
         the player amongst the death and destruction they wreack upon their enemies, that they are still playing a fun, engaging video game. In addition, challenges throughout the game keep even
         expert players on their toes, trying to kill enemies in a certain way, or to complete other goals before they finish the level or within a certain time limit. The most important aspect that
         the developers ensured to keep available is that every action is fun, and has a reward to it. This keeps the player wanting to KEEP playing, for hours into the night like I did.</p>
      <p>While not as surface level as graphics or gameplay, the music and sound design is top notch. There is nothing better than jumping between targeting six different demons at once, all as
         a blistering heavy metal and synth track plays in time with your quick kills and death-defying powerups. The weapons sound brutal, and reflect that impression upon the beats before you.</p>
      <p>The only complaint that I could muster is that the campaign ends a little abruptly, and the final boss is slightly anti-climatic. I won't go into details so as to avoid spoilers, but I could
         see the game lasting for another couple levels at least, or perhaps including a more definitive final enemy that really brings the game to a satisfying close. It ends on a cliffhanger, but one
         that promises a new title soon. To anyone who enjoyed the game (like me), this is exciting, as another chance to defeat enemies in the engine and design that Id Software crafts is a welcome one.
         And, wouldn't you know it, "DOOM: Eternal" was announced at this year's E3 Gaming Conference in June, promising a return of DOOMguy for all the fans out there waiting patiently for a sequel.</p>
      <p>I can't wait to see how innovative and enjoyable the new game will be!</p>
      <p>Rating: 9/10</p>

      <h2>VIDEO GAME SPOTLIGHT: TOM CLANCY'S RAINBOW SIX SIEGE (2015)</h2>
      <h5>A fun and engaging multiplayer tactical shooter, especially enjoyable with friends! August 23rd, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/r6.jpg">
      <p>This game has been on my radar for a very long while. It has immensely favorable reviews from just about everywhere, and is one of the few games to ever only grow
         in player size and mature with age</p>
      <p>I was never the best at first-person shooters back in my younger days playing Call of Duty on Xbox, let alone while trying to adjust to keyboard & mouse in my recent jump
         to the PC world. However, this game allows for players of all skillsets to jump in and make a considerable effort to help their team. Furthermore, that's what this game is
         all about: teamwork. After the decade-long trend of FPS games being oriented on arcade style shooting (CoD, Medal of Honor, and even Battlefield at time) this title takes a
         hard right turn. Running-and-gunning is actively discouraged, and close communication and thinking with other players is required to do well.</p>
      <p>Another extremely unique aspect is the absence of "classes," instead favoring individual operators, each with special skills, abilities, and even personalities. One might focus
         on breaching into reinforced walls, while another can deploy drones that destroy enemy equipment and can even damage hostile players. The developers are constantly improving the
         game, too: they patch bugs, improve map balance, and release new operators and adapt older ones so that the game is always fresh, and there is always a new way to improve.</p>
      <p>In addition, there have a short singleplayer "Situations" game mode to help ease players into the games tactical style, and provide fun challenges to verterans attempting to improve.
         "Terrorist Hunt" is another featured PvE mode, but allows for friends to join and fight off waves of AI fighters while completing an objective. While not as impressive, there are also
         in-depth options for custom games, allowing for fun alternate ways to play with friends.</p>
      <p>I find the game immensely fun, but one must also take into account the availibility of playing with friends. Solo queueing is fun, but is a recipe for rage as you battle extremely
         coordinated five-men squads talking and calling out vulnerablilites to each other. However, with a group of three or more buddies, this game allows for hours of fun and a ranked mode
         to prove oneself against the legion of die-hard fans online.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Recommended?: YES, but try it out on a free-weekend or play at a friend's house before you buy, and try to get it on sale</p>
      <p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Happy hunting!</p>

      <h2>(LATE) WRESTLING REVIEW: WWE SUMMERSLAM 2018</h2>
      <h5>A surprisingly entertaining show, August 22nd, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/summerslam_2018.jpeg">
      <p>Given the current rocky state of the creative team at WWE, I came in with low expecations but ended up enjoying this PPV quite a bit!</p>
      <p>KICKOFF:</p>
      <p>Mixed Tag Team Match - Zelina Vega & Andrade Cien Almas vs. Rusev & Lana</p>
      <p>A great opening match, filled with some humorous moments (Tranquilo!!) and some hard spots (Rusev pushing Almas off the top turnbuckle). Lana
         really began showing her ability in this match - she's getting much better at her in-ring work! Ending leaves a promisin future for this fued.</p>
      <p>Vega (w) pins Lana with her feet on the ropes</p>
      <p>Rating: 2.5/5
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Cruiserweight Championship Match - Cedric Alexander (c) vs. Drew Gulak</p>
      <p>I haven't watched much of 205 Live, yet everytime I tune in for a Cruiserweight bout, I am absolutely blown away! Gulak did a great job of working Alexander's
         neck and implementing that injury into the story of the match. Gulak dominated Alexander throughout, yet the champion left with the title. It begs the question:
         who can actually dethrone the stoic Cedric?</p>
      <p>Alexander (c) beats Gulak by pinfall - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 3.5/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>RAW Tag Team Championship Match - The B-Team (Bo Dalls & Curtis Axel) (c) vs. The Revival (Scott Dawson & Dash Wilder)</p>
      <p>B-Team have been almost a comedy act at this point, but the crowd love them, and they really do add a fun underdog to root for, especially after
         living under The Miz's shadow for so long. The Revival took it to the poor rejects the entire match, but Dallas accidentally assisted Axel for the win.
         A true Kickoff classic!</p>
      <p>Axel (c) pins Wilder - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 3/5</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>KICKOFF Rating: 3/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>MAIN CARD:</p>
      <p>Intercontintental Championship Match - Dolp Ziggler (c) w/ Drew McIntyre vs. Seth Rollins w/ Dean Ambrose</p>
      <p>Ziggler and Rollins really gave it their all this match. Despite opening the show, they tore the house down, and the crowd was red-hot
        for Rollins' win. An engaging climax sequence, and an all around electrifying finish!</p>
      <p>Rollins (c) pins Ziggler - New Champion</p>
      <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Smackdwon Tag Team Championship Match - Bludgeon Brothers (Erik Rowan & Luke Harper) (c) vs. The New Day (Big E & Xavier Woods w/ Kofi Kingston)</p>
      <p>Although a stale matchup at this point, the teams really brought intensity and flavor to the ring. The New Day were high flying, and the Bludgeon Brothers (as always)
         were shocking with their agility and tenacity. An annoying DQ finish, but fun nonetheless</p>
      <p>Bludgeon Brothers DQ themselves - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 3/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Money in the Bank Contract Match - Braun Strowman (h) vs. Kevin Owens</p>
      <p>Total, complete squash. Owens took some gnarly bumps and Strowman looked very strong (and plays into the main event) but it all felt very forced</p>
      <p>Strowman (h) pins Owens - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 1/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Smackdown Women's Championship Triple Threat Match - Carmella (c) vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch</p>
      <p>The match was decent, but the real show came afterwards. Becky had enough of constantly losing, and (heel?) turns on her best friend, Charlotte.
         The inevitable fued between them has the potential to be magical</p>
      <p>Charlotte (c) pins Carmella - New Champion</p>
      <p>Rating: 2.5/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>WWE Championship Match - AJ Styles (c) vs. Samoa Joe</p>
      <p>A great match! But what else can be expected from two all-time great industry legends like Styles and Joe. The back-and-forth was beautiful; no man
         looked to be the clear victor, all the way up to the finish. Joe calls out Styles' family once again, and pays the price. I have a feeling this fued will
         continue to grow and develop into a wonderful anchor for Smackdown</p>
      <p>Styles (c) DQs himself - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 3.75/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Singles Match - The Miz vs. Daniel Bryan</p>
      <p>The match was entertaining enough, despite the crowd kind of being dead - and was growing into a exciting final sequence - but Maryse slips The Miz brass
         knuckles for the win. I hope this fued continues, and at least burns to The Royal Rumble so we could potentially see a Wrestlemania match for the ages.</p>
      <p>The Miz pins Bryan</p>
      <p>Rating: 3.5/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Singles Match - Constable Baron Corbin vs. Finn Balor</p>
      <p>The appearance of "Demon" Balor came as a surprise to me, but really turned what would have been an annoying repeat of Extreme Rules into a story-progressing
         squash.</p>
      <p>Balor pins Corbin</p>
      <p>Rating: 1.5/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>United States Championship Match - Shinsuke Nakamura vs. "Woken" Jeff Hardy</p>
      <p>I almost zoned out during this match - not because I thought it was boring, but because I didn't expect it to be so great! Nakamura and Hardy proved themselves
         once again as amazing performers, and the crowd ate it up. It seems Randy Orton will be joining the midcard championship picture, and I hope the quality matches continue</p>
      <p>Nakamura (c) pins Hardy - Retains</p>
      <p>Rating: 3.75/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>RAW Women's Championship Match - Alexa Bliss (c) vs. Ronda Rousey</p>
      <p>Another squash, but one that showcases Rousey's devastating style and Bliss's cowardice. The beginning of Rousey's title reigns in WWE, and one that I hope
         will eventually result in a dream match agains Charlotte Flair</p>
      <p>Rousey (c) pins Bliss - New Champion</p>
      <p>Rating: 2/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>MAIN EVENT: WWE Universal Championship Match - Brock Lesnar (c) vs. Roman Reigns</p>
      <p>What looked to everyone to be a boring repeat of the last couple years, actually turned out to be exciting - ALL thanks to Strowman. The best thing to come out of this
         match is the potential for Strowman to cash in his contract at some point and finally earn the title he so rightly deserves.</p>
      <p>Roman (c) pins Lesnar - New Champion</p>
      <p>Rating: 2.5/5</p>
      <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Match of the Night: Intercontintental Championship Match between Rollins (new champ) and Ziggler</p>
      <p>MAIN CARD Rating: 3/5</p>

      <h2>ALBUM REVIEW: "THE WALL" - PINK FLOYD (1979)</h2>
      <h5>An emotional masterpiece, flawed by pacing, August 21st, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/TheWall.jpg">
      <p>An album that has hit me at a very vulnerable moment in my life, made all the better by my unabashed love for Pink Floyd and their sound.</p>
      <p>The best way to enjoy this album to the fullest, is with just a little bit of context about the state of Pink Floyd's members, musical goals, and
         reception to public stardom at the time of creation. During the tour for their last album, "Animals" (which may end up in a review as well), the head
         singer/bassist, Roger Waters, became disillusioned with the fans whom only wished to hear the hits and classics from their masterclass work, "Dark Side
         of the Moon," and not the songs from "Animals," with their biting social commentary and long instrumental setpieces. At one point, he even spit at fans
         reaching up at him from right below the stage. He felt, at times, that a "wall" was necessary, both literally and figuratively, between the band and the
         audience. This growing, irking tension, combined with the previous head singer Syd Barrett's decent into madness and drug abuse, became the inspiration
         for a story about a young rock star named Pink, and his attempt to build a mental wall to protect himself after suffering years of emotional trauma, at
         the hands of his school teacher, mother, wife, and many others.<p>
      <p>In the first five songs, we receive an intro to the album as a whole and a glance into the oppressive school system Pink lived through. The music is loud,
         inspiring, but with hints of sadness mixed into the whining guitars of "The Thin Ice," and the funky beats of "Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2." In addition,
         "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" works as a spine-chilling lead-in to the aformentioned hit single, running in with a roaring screech from Waters and the guitar,
         played by David Gilmour (who would eventually take over as lead of the band after Waters' departure).</p>
      <p>At this point, the album enters its second act. Pink is presumably a young artist, singing about his fears to his mother, who is overbearingly protective of Pink,
         to a fault that scars him emotionally. The song is personal, sung by Waters and played on acoustic guitar, and serves as an early view into Pink's pysche that he
         would eventually hide from the outside world. Following this, we hear the lamentations of Pink over losing his father in World War II, mixed in with heavy foreboding
         synths representing the rolling thunder of pain he feels in his heart over his dad's absence. This leads into "Empty Spaces" and then "Young Lust" (which is easily
         my least favorite song on the record, right after "Vera" off disc two). Pink learns of his wife's infedility, and decides to avenge his feelings by taking intimate
         relations with a roadie. However, as the final four songs of disc one show, Pink is a broken, unstable man, suffering a psychotic breakdown in the melancholy "One of
         My Turns," and a total shutdown of all emotion in "Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 3" and "Goodbye Cruel World."</p>
      <p>Disc two begins with "Hey You," a call for Pink to snap out of his funk, and come back to reality (and is also the only song not included on the feature film "Pink Floyd
        - The Wall," which takes this story to the big screen). This leads to a few songs that are better represented by the visuals and storytelling found in the movie, but still
        stand as beautiful short pieces in their own right. "Nobody Home" is an often overlooked hit, highlighted by Richard Wright's eloquent keyboard strokes. Next, a song
        considered by many to be Pink Floyd's greatest ever - "Comfortably Numb" (and one of the few songs on the album not written entirely by Waters). Rogers soulful singing,
        and Gilmour's iconic guitar solo, create a feeling of loss and biting depression that speaks to anyone who has wondered what it'd be like to not have to feel - and never
        again experience heartbreak.</p>
      <p>The album experiencesa jarring turn at this point - Pink is forced into his next show by his manager, barely standing due to the drugs froced into him to make him
         performance ready. He begins to hallucinate - believing himself to be some fascist dictator, becoming the very villain that killed his father. The hallucinations begin in
         "The Show Must Go On," and continues into "In the Flesh," where we see a callback to the intro to the album. Imagining himself ordering a band of Nazi-esque thugs in
         "Run Like Hell" and "Waiting for the Worms," Pink finally has enough, and demands everyone to "Stop." He is put on trial by his subconcious, where an orchestral score rings out
         amongst his mental visualizations of his wife and mother begging him to come out from behind his wall, and live again. The record ends on that note, makinga statement that
         such an emotional structure can certainly protect oneself in the short term, but eventually causes harm to loved ones. It's better to face these problems, with the help of
         trusted individuals who will love and care for you.</p>
      <p>As previously stated, this album rings true for me at an admittedly depressing time in my life, but I know as well as anyone that everything gets better, just as Waters is
         trying to elucidate to the listener.</p>
      <p>Rating: 9/10</p>
      <p>"I cant explain, you would not understand. / This is not how I am. / I have become comfortably numb."</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Stay positive,</p>

      <h2>MOVIE REVIEW: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (1967)</h2>
      <h5>A short opinion on the movie and its highlights, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/TGTBATU.png">
      <p>As the inspiration for this blog, I will try to make this post short but impactful, and dense</p>
      <p>Right from the first scene of the film, we start to see this running motif of the number three. We are introduced
         to our main characters: Tuco, Angel-Eyes, and Blondie. We are briefly shown their personalities, and why each
         is deserving of the role granted to them that the movie's title showcases.</p>
      <p>But beyond that, we are shown how all of our characters actually exhibit every facet that the others seems to
         exude: Angel-Eyes, "the Bad," has an honor code, fulfilling the dying wish of a man he was hired to kill, albiet
         with financial compensation. Tuco is shown to have a soft side for his brother and family, in start contrast to the
         heinous crimes he has was convicted for earlier. And blondie, the stoic Clint Eastwood, is briefly reduced to a hobbling
         cripple after his forced excursion into the desert by Tuco.</p>
      <p>We viewers realize that the title does not actually enumerate the three ruffians, but rather is a description they all share:
         none of them are just good, bad, or ugly, they all are, to different degrees.</p>
      <p>An often overlooked facet of this piece of cinema is the subtext of the Civil War waging on in the background,
         and at times, becomes the full attention of the characters despite their greed and desire for their treasure.
         In the final act, we see the Union Captain drunkenly ranting about how thousands of innocent soldiers are dying
         defending one lousy bridge. Blondie and Tuco destroy it mainly to further their own goals, but also feel for the soldiers
         and their plights, as they are human too.</p>
      <p>To the modern viewer, the humanizing characterization of the Confederate troops might come as a surprise.
         Were they not murderous traitors, fighting for their right to own a human being? Without turning this movie review
         into a history lesson, YES they were. But at the same time they were people: they had families, loved ones, goals,
         and at the end of the day, they didn't want to die. And really, who does?</p>
      <p>On a more technical note, the cinematography and set design is absolutely spectacular. One really feels like they are
         there, in the shanty towns, fighting on the battlefields, and a part of the shootouts. Long shots of the surrounding land
         give a beautiful view of the desert ecosystem, and only enhances the viewing experience</p>
      <p>And of course, one cannot discuss this piece of work without mentioning the iconic ending. The spell-binding musical
         score combined with the nerve-wracking tension built up in the final scene of the three-hour epic, and the ultimate
         culmination of the main characters' greed and aggressions leads to one of the most heart-stopping and memorable
         climaxes in cinema history</p>
      <p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>

      <p>So long!</p>

      <h5>Welcome and personal notes, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/nebula.jpg">
      <p>In a way, this might end up being more of a personal online journal for me than a true blog.</p>
      <p>I'll try not to let it end up like that! This whole idea came after re-watching a favorite movie of mine.
         "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," directed by Sergio Leone. Widely acclaimed as the pinnacle of spaghetti westerns,
         I found I was commenting to myself about the movie's structure, motif, and gripping ending.</p>
      <p>I consider myself a minor movie buff, and in the past have considered writing as a movie critic in my spare time.
         I paused, and thought, "Why not just make a website and put my thoughts on there?" And so, the seed of passion was
         planted into my brain. With my newfound experience with basic html and css from my summer internship, I whipped up
         this site in a day, and will most likely host it with Amazon Web Services (they have a "free tier" for small sites).</p>
      <p>God only knows if I'll continue to keep this up for more thank a couple days, but I can see a fun side activity like this
         lasting me for many moons.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Until next time!</p>
