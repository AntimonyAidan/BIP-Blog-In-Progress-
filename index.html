      <h2>ALBUM REVIEW: "THE WALL" - PINK FLOYD (1979)</h2>
      <h5>An emotional masterpiece, flawed by pacing, August 21st, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/TheWall.jpg">
      <p>An album that has hit me at a very vulnerable moment in my life, made all the better by my unabashed love for Pink Floyd and their sound.</p>
      <p>The best way to enjoy this album to the fullest, is with just a little bit of context about the state of Pink Floyd's members, musical goals, and
         reception to public stardom at the time of creation. During the tour for their last album, "Animals" (which may end up in a review as well), the head
         singer/bassist, Roger Waters, became disillusioned with the fans whom only wished to hear the hits and classics from their masterclass work, "Dark Side
         of the Moon," and not the songs from "Animals," with their biting social commentary and long instrumental setpieces. At one point, he even spit at fans
         reaching up at him from right below the stage. He felt, at times, that a "wall" was necessary, both literally and figuratively, between the band and the
         audience. This growing, irking tension, combined with the previous head singer Syd Barrett's decent into madness and drug abuse, became the inspiration
         for a story about a young rock star named Pink, and his attempt to build a mental wall to protect himself after suffering years of emotional trauma, at
         the hands of his school teacher, mother, wife, and many others.<p>
      <p>In the first five songs, we receive an intro to the album as a whole and a glance into the oppressive school system Pink lived through. The music is loud,
         inspiring, but with hints of sadness mixed into the whining guitars of "The Thin Ice," and the funky beats of "Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2." In addition,
         "The Happiest Days of Our Lives" works as a spine-chilling lead-in to the aformentioned hit single, running in with a roaring screech from Waters and the guitar,
         played by David Gilmour (who would eventually take over as lead of the band after Waters' departure).</p>
      <p>At this point, the album enters its second act. Pink is presumably a young artist, singing about his fears to his mother, who is overbearingly protective of Pink,
         to a fault that scars him emotionally. The song is personal, sung by Waters and played on acoustic guitar, and serves as an early view into Pink's pysche that he
         would eventually hide from the outside world. Following this, we hear the lamentations of Pink over losing his father in World War II, mixed in with heavy foreboding
         synths representing the rolling thunder of pain he feels in his heart over his dad's absence. This leads into "Empty Spaces" and then "Young Lust" (which is easily
         my least favorite song on the record, right after "Vera" off disc two). Pink learns of his wife's infedility, and decides to avenge his feelings by taking intimate
         relations with a roadie. However, as the final four songs of disc one show, Pink is a broken, unstable man, suffering a psychotic breakdown in the melancholy "One of
         My Turns," and a total shutdown of all emotion in "Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 3" and "Goodbye Cruel World."</p>
      <p>Disc two begins with "Hey You," a call for Pink to snap out of his funk, and come back to reality (and is also the only song not included on the feature film "Pink Floyd
        - The Wall," which takes this story to the big screen). This leads to a few songs that are better represented by the visuals and storytelling found in the movie, but still
        stand as beautiful short pieces in their own right. "Nobody Home" is an often overlooked hit, highlighted by Richard Wright's eloquent keyboard strokes. Next, a song
        considered by many to be Pink Floyd's greatest ever - "Comfortably Numb" (and one of the few songs on the album not written entirely by Waters). Rogers soulful singing,
        and Gilmour's iconic guitar solo, create a feeling of loss and biting depression that speaks to anyone who has wondered what it'd be like to not have to feel - and never
        again experience heartbreak.</p>
      <p>The album experiencesa jarring turn at this point - Pink is forced into his next show by his manager, barely standing due to the drugs froced into him to make him
         performance ready. He begins to hallucinate - believing himself to be some fascist dictator, becoming the very villain that killed his father. The hallucinations begin in
         "The Show Must Go On," and continues into "In the Flesh," where we see a callback to the intro to the album. Imagining himself ordering a band of Nazi-esque thugs in
         "Run Like Hell" and "Waiting for the Worms," Pink finally has enough, and demands everyone to "Stop." He is put on trial by his subconcious, where an orchestral score rings out
         amongst his mental visualizations of his wife and mother begging him to come out from behind his wall, and live again. The record ends on that note, makinga statement that
         such an emotional structure can certainly protect oneself in the short term, but eventually causes harm to loved ones. It's better to face these problems, with the help of
         trusted individuals who will love and care for you.</p>
      <p>As previously stated, this album rings true for me at an admittedly depressing time in my life, but I know as well as anyone that everything gets better, just as Waters is
         trying to elucidate to the listener.</p>
      <p>Rating: 9/10</p>
      <p>"I cant explain, you would not understand. / This is not how I am. / I have become comfortably numb."</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Stay positive,</p>

      <h2>MOVIE REVIEW: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY (1967)</h2>
      <h5>A short opinion on the movie and its highlights, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/TGTBATU.png">
      <p>As the inspiration for this blog, I will try to make this post short but impactful, and dense</p>
      <p>Right from the first scene of the film, we start to see this running motif of the number three. We are introduced
         to our main characters: Tuco, Angel-Eyes, and Blondie. We are briefly shown their personalities, and why each
         is deserving of the role granted to them that the movie's title showcases.</p>
      <p>But beyond that, we are shown how all of our characters actually exhibit every facet that the others seems to
         exude: Angel-Eyes, "the Bad," has an honor code, fulfilling the dying wish of a man he was hired to kill, albiet
         with financial compensation. Tuco is shown to have a soft side for his brother and family, in start contrast to the
         heinous crimes he has was convicted for earlier. And blondie, the stoic Clint Eastwood, is briefly reduced to a hobbling
         cripple after his forced excursion into the desert by Tuco.</p>
      <p>We viewers realize that the title does not actually enumerate the three ruffians, but rather is a description they all share:
         none of them are just good, bad, or ugly, they all are, to different degrees.</p>
      <p>An often overlooked facet of this piece of cinema is the subtext of the Civil War waging on in the background,
         and at times, becomes the full attention of the characters despite their greed and desire for their treasure.
         In the final act, we see the Union Captain drunkenly ranting about how thousands of innocent soldiers are dying
         defending one lousy bridge. Blondie and Tuco destroy it mainly to further their own goals, but also feel for the soldiers
         and their plights, as they are human too.</p>
      <p>To the modern viewer, the humanizing characterization of the Confederate troops might come as a surprise.
         Were they not murderous traitors, fighting for their right to own a human being? Without turning this movie review
         into a history lesson, YES they were. But at the same time they were people: they had families, loved ones, goals,
         and at the end of the day, they didn't want to die. And really, who does?</p>
      <p>On a more technical note, the cinematography and set design is absolutely spectacular. One really feels like they are
         there, in the shanty towns, fighting on the battlefields, and a part of the shootouts. Long shots of the surrounding land
         give a beautiful view of the desert ecosystem, and only enhances the viewing experience</p>
      <p>And of course, one cannot discuss this piece of work without mentioning the iconic ending. The spell-binding musical
         score combined with the nerve-wracking tension built up in the final scene of the three-hour epic, and the ultimate
         culmination of the main characters' greed and aggressions leads to one of the most heart-stopping and memorable
         climaxes in cinema history</p>
      <p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>
      <p>"You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig."</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>So long!</p>

      <h2>INITIAL POST</h2>
      <h5>Welcome and personal notes, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/nebula.jpg">
      <p>In a way, this might end up being more of a personal online journal for me than a true blog.</p>
      <p>I'll try not to let it end up like that! This whole idea came after re-watching a favorite movie of mine.
         "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," directed by Sergio Leone. Widely acclaimed as the pinnacle of spaghetti westerns,
         I found I was commenting to myself about the movie's structure, motif, and gripping ending.</p>
      <p>I consider myself a minor movie buff, and in the past have considered writing as a movie critic in my spare time.
         I paused, and thought, "Why not just make a website and put my thoughts on there?" And so, the seed of passion was
         planted into my brain. With my newfound experience with basic html and css from my summer internship, I whipped up
         this site in a day, and will most likely host it with Amazon Web Services (they have a "free tier" for small sites).</p>
      <p>God only knows if I'll continue to keep this up for more thank a couple days, but I can see a fun side activity like this
         lasting me for many moons.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Until next time!</p>
