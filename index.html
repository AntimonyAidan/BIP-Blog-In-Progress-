      <h2>MOVIE REVIEW: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY</h2>
      <h5>A short opinion on the movie and its highlights, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/TGTBATU.png">
      <p>As the inspiration for this blog, I will try to make this post short but impactful, and dense</p>
      <p>Right from the first scene of the film, we start to see this running motif of the number three. We are introduced
         to our main characters: Tuco, Angel-Eyes, and Blondie. We are briefly shown their personalities, and why each
         is deserving of the role granted to them that the movie's title showcases.</p>
      <p>But beyond that, we are shown how all of our characters actually exhibit every facet that the others seems to
         exude: Angel-Eyes, "the Bad," has an honor code, fulfilling the dying wish of a man he was hired to kill, albiet
         with financial compensation. Tuco is shown to have a soft side for his brother and family, in start contrast to the
         heinous crimes he has was convicted for earlier. And blondie, the stoic Clint Eastwood, is briefly reduced to a hobbling
         cripple after his forced excursion into the desert by Tuco.</p>
      <p>We viewers realize that the title does not actually enumerate the three ruffians, but rather is a description they all share:
         none of them are just good, bad, or ugly, they all are, to different degrees.</p>
      <p>An often overlooked facet of this piece of cinema is the subtext of the Civil War waging on in the background,
         and at times, becomes the full attention of the characters despite their greed and desire for their treasure.
         In the final act, we see the Union Captain drunkenly ranting about how thousands of innocent soldiers are dying
         defending one lousy bridge. Blondie and Tuco destroy it mainly to further their own goals, but also feel for the soldiers
         and their plights, as they are human too.</p>
      <p>To the modern viewer, the humanizing characterization of the Confederate troops might come as a surprise.
         Were they not murderous traitors, fighting for their right to own a human being? Without turning this movie review
         into a history lesson, YES they were. But at the same time they were people: they had families, loved ones, goals,
         and at the end of the day, they didn't want to die. And really, who does?</p>
      <p>On a more technical note, the cinematography and set design is absolutely spectacular. One really feels like they are
         there, in the shanty towns, fighting on the battlefields, and a part of the shootouts. Long shots of the surrounding land
         give a beautiful view of the desert ecosystem, and only enhances the viewing experience</p>
      <p>And of course, one cannot discuss this piece of work without mentioning the iconic ending. The spell-binding musical
         score combined with the nerve-wracking tension built up in the final scene of the three-hour epic, and the ultimate
         culmination of the main characters' greed and aggressions leads to one of the most heart-stopping and memorable
         climaxes in cinema history</p>
      <p>Rating: 9.5/10</p>
      <p>"You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig."</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>So long!</p>

      <h5>Welcome and personal notes, August 20th, 2018</h5>
      <img src="images/nebula.jpg">
      <p>In a way, this might end up being more of a personal online journal for me than a true blog.</p>
      <p>I'll try not to let it end up like that! This whole idea came after re-watching a favorite movie of mine.
         "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly," directed by Sergio Leone. Widely acclaimed as the pinnacle of spaghetti westerns,
         I found I was commenting to myself about the movie's structure, motif, and gripping ending.</p>
      <p>I consider myself a minor movie buff, and in the past have considered writing as a movie critic in my spare time.
         I paused, and thought, "Why not just make a website and put my thoughts on there?" And so, the seed of passion was
         planted into my brain. With my newfound experience with basic html and css from my summer internship, I whipped up
         this site in a day, and will most likely host it with Amazon Web Services (they have a "free tier" for small sites).</p>
      <p>God only knows if I'll continue to keep this up for more thank a couple days, but I can see a fun side activity like this
         lasting me for many moons.</p>
      <p><br /></p>
      <p>Until next time!</p>
